# Observational Memory — Load Context

Before proceeding with any work, check if the observational memory system is installed and load the user's behavioral profile.

## Step 1: Check Installation

Check if `~/.observational-memory/memory.db` exists.

**If it exists**, skip to Step 2.

**If it does NOT exist**, tell the user to run `om install` in their terminal. That single command handles everything — directories, database, hooks, API key prompt. If `om` is not found, they need `pip install observational-memory` first. Do NOT walk them through manual steps.

Once setup is complete, continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Load Behavioral Context

1. Read `~/.observational-memory/memory/global.md` — core behavioral rules. Apply as firm instructions.
2. Read `~/.observational-memory/memory/global_context.md` if it exists — contextual annotations and provenance. Apply as informational background (explains *why* rules exist, flags evolving patterns). Not directive.
3. Derive the project slug from the current working directory basename: lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric characters with `-`, strip leading/trailing `-`.
4. Check if `~/.observational-memory/memory/projects/{slug}.md` exists. If it does, read it — project-specific core rules. Apply as firm instructions.
5. Check if `~/.observational-memory/memory/projects/{slug}_context.md` exists. If it does, read it — project-specific contextual annotations. Apply as informational background.
6. When global and project rules conflict, project rules take precedence.

## Step 3: Confirm

After loading, print a single-line confirmation so the user knows the skill ran. Format:

`Observational memory loaded: global (Xk chars), {slug} (Xk chars)` — listing only the files that were found and loaded. If no files were found, print `Observational memory: no profiles generated yet`.

## Important

- If `global.md` does not exist yet, skip it — the memory system has not yet generated observations. This is normal on a fresh install before any sessions have been observed.
- Core files (`global.md`, `{slug}.md`) are rules — follow them strictly.
- Context files (`global_context.md`, `{slug}_context.md`) are informational — they explain the *why* behind rules and flag things that might be evolving. Use them to understand intent, not as directives.
